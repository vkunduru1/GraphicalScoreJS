# GraphicalScoreJS
My Masters Project

This project attempts to innovate and digitalize the Graphical Score concept, by exploring the mappings between hand gestures, colours and sounds to create artwork as well as musical compositions. This is represented as a browser-based web-application, developed using a combination of Web Development tools and Object Orientated Programming concepts.

This project follows the Test Driven Development(TDD) method Red, Green Refactoring (Red, Green, Refactor | Codecademy, 2020), where tests are written in order to drive the design and development process of the software application.

The implementation was separated into these main stages:

- Leap Motion Finger Tracking on Canvas
- Rendering Shapes using Gestures
- Audio Output

To run the project:
